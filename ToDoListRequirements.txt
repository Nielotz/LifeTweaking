Main motivaitions:
	- easy search - for now simple organizing were enough
	- allow for partial share
	- search by profit (more info below)
	- search by time

Projects (todoist free plan limits to 5):

		- Scope: home environment 
		- Share with: flatmates
	- SECURITY:
		- Reason: you do wanna get pwned arent ya?
		- Scope: cyber life 
		- Share with: trusted

Tags:
	- Reasons: 
		- Trade time assigning for: 
			- Prioritization - some things needs to be done faster than others 
			- Efficiency and better organization - group similar task together? - saves time later
			- Profitability - some task are more valuable than others
	- Time related:
		- Story points - SP0.25, SP0.5, SP1, SP2, etc. (fibbonacci scale + 0.25, 0.5?)
			- Reason: required for planning
	- Topic related:
		- SAFE (personal *safe*ty):
			- Reason: its good to be safe
		- ~~SEC (IT *sec*urity)~~ cancelled due to project commited to it
	- Worthness:
		- Reason: required for optimal planning; consumes resources to estimate:(
		- In points (scale as SP with "W" prefix, eg.: W1, W2)
		- Formula: TBD
	- Cost:
		- Reason: some tasks may be undoable due to high costs at the moment
		- In points (scale as SP with "C" prefix, eg.: C1, C2)

TODOIST specific:
	p1, p2, p3, p4 are used in daily planning:
		p1 - things have to be done today, max 1 item / multiple task with SP sum up to SP1
		p2 - things to do after p1, up to SP4
		p3 - things to do after p2, up to SP8
		p4 - things to do when desire hits but other tasks were annihilated, no limits
	Overdue tasks - up to 3 tasks, low priority tasks but with special importance, preferably should be done right after p4
